        <p>Here’s a question. You lead a customer service team. You know how to hire, train and develop top talent. You’ve cut costs where necessary and still provide excellent customer experience. You built a team that’s empathetic and efficient.</p>

        <p>And now you realize that AI is going to upend it all. AI has a lower cost per call. It can respond with a 0-second SLA. It works 24/7. It won’t leave your company after training. And it can scale infinitely.</p>

        <p>But when you try to implement AI in your company, all hell breaks loose. The AI is hallucinating non-existent discounts. Customers are screaming “Get me a human” into their phones. Your team is demotivated. And then you get the bill, and it turns out that your cost per call has gone up.</p>

        <p>Sure, AI has to learn and train itself. And the integrations are brittle and highly technical. But you’re not sure it’s worth all the disruption it’s causing.</p>

        <p>How do you implement AI without disrupting your own operations?</p>

        <p>We’ve been trying to solve this problem for the past 2 years, ever since AI agents became possible with GPT-3.5. We’ve built AI agents for EU banks, global mobility companies and UK’s fastest growing Fintech.</p>

        <p>We learned that to really put an AI agent into production, it has to do everything a human can do at the same level as one. And it has to do this out of the box.</p>

        <p>That’s why we built a framework that deploys AI into large customer service teams in 3 steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Train the AI with top 1% AI trainers who work side-by-side with your team. The AI should be able to pass the assessment that humans do.</li>
            <li>Integrate the best-in-class text and voice models deep into your business processes, making sure that anything a human can do in this job, the AI can, too.</li>
            <li>Iterate with you for several months to bring the AI to better-than-human performance that you fully understand and control.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We’re testing the framework with a few select customers with outstanding results. There is a lot to improve, but we think we found the best way to implement AI in a large customer service team today.</p>

        <p>You don’t need to upend your whole operations to implement AI.</p>

        <p>Don’t disrupt.</p>
